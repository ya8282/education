* Bits and Bytes (1983 "TV Ontario" TV Series) [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_T5mvuguw&list=PL77441A2ED0D0B6A8)
Nostalgia aside, this series teaches computer usage as well as basic (and BASIC) programming concepts in an epoch before the internet was popularized through a conversational dialog between teacher and learner. Features superb quotes seeded with humor; even the soundtrack is informative.
